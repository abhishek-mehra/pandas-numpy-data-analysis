# Data Analysis with Pandas and Numpy
This repository contains Python code that demonstrates various operations that can be performed on a Pandas dataframe and a Numpy array. Pandas is a popular Python library that is used for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning, while Numpy is used for numerical computations.

## Operations Demonstrated

### Pandas dataframe:
Printing the number of rows for which traffic values are higher than 10,000.  
Printing the names of all the columns in the dataframe.  
Printing a subset of the dataframe containing the 10th and 3rd rows of the original dataframe.  
Determining the US state with the 8th largest total airport traffic.  
Determining the state with the second-most total number of airports.  
Identifying the city with the least total traffic for all airports among those with multiple airports.  
Calculating the total airport traffic for all states that border the state of Massachusetts.  


### Numpy array:
Determining the shape, number of dimensions and type of elements in a Numpy array.  
Determining the standard deviation of all elements in a Numpy array.  
Determining the position (not the value) of the maximum value element in a Numpy array.  
Creating an array of the same shape as a given Numpy array but filled with zeros.  
Creating an array of the same shape as a given Numpy array but filled with ones.  
Creating an array of the same shape as a given Numpy array but where all elements are the square root values.  
Creating an array result of shape 12 by 12 resulting from multiplication of a given Numpy array with its transpose.
